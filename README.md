# Lighting and Sound Assignment
Assignment 4: Lighting and Sound

Assignment Overview
In this assignment the student will create a 3D environment in Unity where the overall aim is to achieve significant realism which enhances UX and user immersion.

The scene content does not have to be exciting; it could be very mundane e.g. a waiting room. However, most importantly the lighting and sound effects must be thoughtfully designed and executed to achieve as great a level of realism as possible in an application that is performance-optimized.

The use of NPCs, interactable A/V objects (simple examples might be light switches or radios), directional sound, reverb zones and realistic baked lighting are all encouraged and form part of the assessment.

We encourage you to use a physically scanned item, either as an NPC or other object and incorporate it in your scene.
